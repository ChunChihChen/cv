       Hi, I am Elvis Chen. I am an assistant professor in Department of International Business, National Taichung University of Science and Technology, Taiwan. <br> My research interests are circular economy, energy economy/policy, and sustainability.<br>
       I obtained PhD from National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University in 2020. <br>During my doctoral trajectory, I have accomplished three papers related to my research field published in the well-known journals. <br>
       I was also awarded a two-year fellowship by the Ministry of Education of Taiwan and visited North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC as a visiting scholar.<br>
       I also participated in a conference(2nd International Conference on Energy Research and Social Science)in Arizona State University. by the time. <br>This was a precious opportunity to broaden my experiences, such as different cultures and lifestyles.<br>
       Currently, I am an an assistant professor in Department of International Business, National Taichung University of Science and Technology. <br>
       If you are looking for a researcher who has a good sense of humor to collaborate on the circular economy, sustainability and data mining, please feel free to send me the message. <br>
       I am open-minded and welcome working with different researchers. I am also a sports enthusiast, which means you can discuss it with me beside the research :D
